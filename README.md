### Hi, I'm Frederik Lange
- 👨‍💻 I'm a political scientist turned data scientist.
- 📚 I'm interested in machine learning, language modelling, and behavioural approaches to social and business researh.
- 🔨 I'm fluent in R and Python, and I love to learn more about programming and computer science in my free time. Therefore, I'm also currently signed up at [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) to learn more about back-end developing.
